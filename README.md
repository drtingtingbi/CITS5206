<summary> Project 1: Development of cost-effective soil moisture monitoring system for Broadacre Cropping - UWA
 </summary>


**Project Overview** : 
Western Australia's cereal industry is worth over $6 billion dollars annually. The Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, creates specific challenges for farmers. Operational windows for field activities are short and often aligned with rainfall events, making precise soil moisture monitoring essential for efficient and sustainable farming practices. 
This capstone project aims to develop a cost-effective soil moisture sensing system specifically designed for broadacre cropping in the cereal industry of Western Australia. The system will use appropriate sensors to estimate soil moisture at various depths along with location information, communicate to a local appropriate hub/server and further send aggregated data over the internet to a server. A designed dashboard will give useful insight to farmers to make decisions, enabling farmers to determine the optimal times for using farm machinery without risking soil compaction or becoming bogged down. 

**Project Plan**: 
1. System Design: 
•	Choice of sensors for soil moisture, location and related microcontroller. Appropriate power mechanism choice 
•	Catering for the environmental effects (waterproofing, rust and damage control etc) 
•	Mechanism for depth variation 
•	Choice of Communication Technology  
•	Selection of attributes for the Dashboard 
•	Dashboard design 
•	Cost Analysis

2. Development of Lab prototype and its demonstration

<summary> Project 2: Curriculum App - UWA
 </summary>

**Project Overview** : 
The project seeks to develop an intuitive interface for managing course rules across various university courses. It will integrate both standard and custom criteria, ensuring adherence to the university's governance requirements for formatting and documentation. The system will feature an optimized data structure and user interface to ensure data consistency for downstream processes like admissions. This will streamline administrative tasks, and enhance the user and student experience by ensuring the integrity of the data that flows through to admissions. <b>Unit Set Builder</b> The project aimed at creating a user-friendly interface to manage the various types of unit sets that are associated with each course/major. It involves various complex scenarios that need to be considered. The goal is to develop a UI and data structure that efficiently handles diverse scenarios where unit sets consist of nested groups with unique attributes per group and element. This system should be optimized to respond effectively to various types of queries, including those related to study planning.

<summary> Project 10: Conventional transactions on blockchains. - CSIRO </summary>

**Project Overview** : 
Notes: Conventional transactions on blockchains require explicit and specific action claims, whereas intent-based transactions allow for more vague or natural language expressions, which might make the queries less precise. The goal of this project is to create a Large Language Model (LLM)-based middleware that acts as an intermediary between users and blockchain platforms. This middleware will be capable of intelligently analyzing and translating these less defined user queries into a data format that is compatible with blockchain systems, utilizing accessible external resources and a sustained knowledge graph.

For instance, consider a user interested in exchanging cryptocurrencies but unsure of the exact parameters or commands typically required by blockchain interfaces. The user inputs a vague request into the LLM: "I want to swap some of my ETH for BTC, getting the best possible rate." The LLM processes this input and then generates precise, JSON-formatted transaction proposals. The output would include detailed transaction parameters such as the specific amount of ETH to be exchanged, the equivalent BTC value at the current exchange rate, and any applicable transaction fees. Additionally, if the request lacks necessary details, the middleware might generate follow-up questions to clarify the amount of ETH the user wishes to exchange or confirm the transaction's urgency to fetch the best possible rate.

<summary> Project 11: Enhancing Academic Review Efficiency with A Token-based Incentive System: Design and Simulation Using LLM. - CSIRO </summary>

**Project Overview** : 
"Enhancing Academic Review Efficiency with a Token-Based Incentive System: Design and Simulation Using LLM

In recent years, academic researchers, particularly in fast-evolving fields like AI and cybersecurity, have increasingly preferred submitting papers to conferences due to their faster review processes and strict deadlines. This shift is driven by the need for timely dissemination of findings, contrasting sharply with traditional journals that often face delays due to challenges in recruiting voluntary reviewers and absence of hard deadlines. This project aims to develop and assess a token-based incentive mechanism designed to encourage timely and high-quality reviews. Through ""what-if"" simulations conducted by a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent, we will evaluate the effectiveness and identify any potential improvements of this system.

Consider Dr. Smith, an AI researcher, who uses the token-based system to prioritize her conference paper submission. Simultaneously, Dr. Jones, a reviewer, earns tokens by promptly completing high-quality reviews. These tokens ensure his future submissions are also prioritized. This reciprocal incentive system not only motivates efficient reviewing but also ensures quick feedback cycles, crucial for maintaining momentum in dynamic research areas. The project’s LLM-based agent will simulate various operational scenarios of this incentive mechanism to refine its design before any practical implementation."

<summary> Project 13: Accreditation Mapper - UWA </summary>

**Project Overview** : 



Accreditation is awarded to a university program of study after a rigorous evaluation of their capacity to produce graduates who have the knowledge and skills required of an ICT professional. Professional accreditation of university programs is an important and complex task, in which program organisation, unit and program outcomes, and professional competencies need to be documented and explorable. Furthermore, accreditation information is required in different forms by many different stakeholders.  This project is to generate a variety of outputs for reporting and visualising accreditation outcomes.  Outputs will range from written reports and spreadsheets to interactive visualisations.  This project is highly iterative, and the project group will have flexibility in the types of outputs generated.
The UWA Accreditation Mapper software will:
1)	Import course accreditation information (initially provided in a spreadsheet)
2)	Export reports for accreditation in several formats, such as printed documents, graphics, or spreadsheets
3) Quality assurance functions can be added if time permits

<summary> Project 14: Geophysics for Mapping Soil Conditions and Time-lapse Visualisations - UWA </summary>

Precision farming uses sensors and data analytics to improve knowledge of and response to local conditions in agriculture. Several projects collect electric resistivity data daily (with 5+ sites in Australia where this is done as part of the critical zone project). The time-lapse data we get are simple ascii files of voltage and electric current with a geometry of the electrodes used in the field.
This file undergoes a data inversion with several iterations using a least mean squares algorithm. Various software programs can do that, including a Python-based program called pyGIMLI. The code is freely available.
GIMLI produces a data file which then needs to be loaded into a data visualization software. Work is in progress on an automated process for loading and processing data.

The aim for the data visualisation part is to have resistivities converted to soil water contents and then visualised in a time-lapse video or similar with date and rainfall. Drawing from the work done in the 2023 Capstone project the aim is to produce and finalise a software package that supports the whole workflow from data ingest to visualisation.

The end users would be farmers, hydrologists, soil scientists and also for teaching.
The main datasets being produced are confidential due to the nature of their collaborators (Department of Water). However, there are existing data sets that could be used for setting up the whole application. The software should be able to run on a standard laptop and be platform-independent as far as possible. The solution should be modular so that future projects can build on this platform. Data and user guidance for this system will be provided to the project team by the clients.
